Well... at this state of development there is not much to install.

Just some notes:

- To run it as a real daemon You have to compile it without defining DEBUG
  in the makefile. If You compile it with DEBUG, it won't fork.

- I did some very small modifications to libipq, so please use the one
  provided in this package and NOT the one from the iptables package.
  I expect this to change soon - If my changes get accepted into libipq

- I provide a source-compatible library (libipqmpd) as replacement for
  libipq. So You only have to recompile Your ip_queue using program and 
  link it against libilqmpd instead of libipq.
  In the future I want to be binary compatible with libipq.

- AGAIN: This software is completely new and almost untested. It works
  at least for me :) Bugfixes / Comments / Ideas are appreciated.
